About me

I'm Creative Director and UI/UX Designer from Sydney, Australia, working in développement web and print media. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.

My job is to build your website so that it is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive. Moreover, I add personal touch to your product and make sure that is eye-catching and easy to use. My aim is to bring across your message and identity in the most creative way. I created projet personnel for many famous brand companies.

# veille

Docker — Conteneurisation & orchestration

1) Origine et contexte : pourquoi Docker a “pris” — image immuable, partage via registries, workflow CI/CD simplifié.

2) Frise chronologique (jalons) :
  - 2013 — Naissance de Docker.
  - 2014 — Docker Hub & images officielles.
  - 2015 — Docker Compose (multi-conteneurs local).
  - 2017 — Kubernetes s'impose pour l'orchestration.
  - 2019 — Écosystème mature, focus sécurité.
  - 2024 — Industrialisation, policies et supply chain.
  - 2025 — Optimisation des runtimes et intégration CI/CD/observabilité.

3) Docker aujourd'hui — points clés : Docker Engine, Images & Registries, containerd/OCI, Docker Desktop, aspects réseau/stockage/sécurité/orchestration.

4) Liens & mots-clés pour la veille : Docker Docs, Kubernetes, Trivy. Mots-clés : Docker, containerization, OCI, Dockerfile, Compose, Kubernetes, images, registries, security scanning.

5) Mini plan de TP : écrire Dockerfile, exécuter conteneur, docker-compose multi-services, scanner image, pousser vers registry et déployer sur cluster.
